<h1 class="about">overviwe for bioshock infinite </h1>
<p class="par2">BioShock Infinite wisely abandons Rapture for an all new story in an all new setting, introducing us to the cloud city of Columbia. Ruled by the self-proclaimed Prophet, Father Comstock, Columbia is every American’s idea of Heaven — provided that American is affluent, white, and fiercely proud of those traits. As Booker DeWitt, players are sent to Columbia by mysterious employers to retrieve Elizabeth — a woman held sacred as “The Lamb” by Comstock and his flock, held under lock and key for unsurprisingly sinister ends.

Columbia is a far cry from the devastated shadow of glory that was Rapture. Populated and idyllic, at the peak of its greatness, Comstock’s city in the sky is pristine and beautiful. Upon first stepping out into the sun-drenched 1910s utopia, I was quite suitably awed at the beautiful architecture and charmed by the sights and sounds — from bantering pedestrians to barbershop quartets floating by in miniature airships, delighting me with a Beach Boys song. Yes, in a 1910s utopia.</p>

<h1 class="about">Combat system</h1>
<p class="par2">As a game, Infinite retains many familiar elements of BioShock, though it’s an altogether faster, more action-based experience. The densely populated, brightly lit world of Columbia is no place to evoke the creeping tension of the first game, so Infinite instead focuses on chaotic combat and heavy duty weaponry. In some ways, this leads to a game with less creativity than BioShock. Booker’s guns and special abilities are geared far more consistently toward the direct offensive approach, and enemies are brutally efficient enough to where one never gets to really “play around” with them like one previously could. This is not to say, however, that combat is more straightforward and dull. On the contrary, it works harder to achieve a sense of dynamism, an effort that largely pays off Once Booker encounters Elizabeth, combat gets even more interesting. It soon becomes apparent Comstock’s hostage has the unique power to tear holes into other realities — an important plot point, but something that has its use in battle as well. Various areas are littered with rifts in reality through which Elizabeth can bring predetermined supplies or summon allied turrets and mechanical warriors. By simply looking at the desired tear and holding a button, Booker can ask Elizabeth to open it and bring through whatever is inside. It’s a great idea, which suffers only from the frequent distraction of noise and flashing light designed to draw the player’s attention to the nearest tear. It can be slightly bothersome to run through an environment crammed full of tears and get a big “whooshing” effect every few seconds.</p>



<h1 class="about">Drinkin’ and Shootin</h1>
<p class="par2">And what of the rank-and-file bad guys you’ll be shooting at? Some of them seem borderline comical, like the Patriot robots modeled after George Washington, who Columbia’s residents revere as a god. Then there are the Handymen -- intimidating 10-foot-tall proto-cyborgs who freaked me out the first time I thought I'd escaped them but, in fact, hadn’t. They’re much more agile than they look, even if they’re essentially bullet-spongy Big Daddies on PEDs. At least the AI is wise enough to use cover and the Skylines to keep you on your toes and even the odds.
From the moment you begin fighting your first barely competent Columbia cops early on, vigors – nee plasmids – bolster your offense with potent table-turners like the target-zapping Shock Jockey or Charge’s directed speed burst. My go-to, Bucking Bronco, floats targets up in the air for a few moments, letting you pick them off like (paralyzed) fish in a barrel. Some vigors are essentially reskinned abilities from the first BioShock, and all are familiar from one game or another; the ability to charge them up to lay them down like mines is the only thing that really sets them apart, though I rarely saw fit to use their secondary functions. But they're a useful toolset, and odds are you’ll find a couple you favor above the others -- particularly in their impressively powerful upgraded forms.</p>



<h1 class="about">Dusty Old Boxes</h1>
<p class="par2">Having played BioShock Infinite on all three platforms, I've found that some of the combat system’s inherent versatility and wealth of options are restricted by the gamepad control scheme on the console versions. Oddly, only two weapons and two vigors can be hotkeyed at any given time (via a quick tap of the Xbox’s shoulder buttons or the PS3’s triggers). The rest of your arsenal is accessible, of course, but you must pause and go into a menu in order to get to them. That can break up the fun flow of an otherwise high-octane encounter, and picking the right tool for the job during the fight was something I found myself avoiding. As you might expect, though, this is a non-issue on the PC, where the number keys offer instant access to vigors.
Aging console graphics hardware lets down Infinite, too. When the original BioShock debuted on Xbox 360 in 2007, it was an eye-gasmic wonder – a blissful marriage of Art Deco art direction with top-shelf graphics technology. Fast-forward almost six years, and Infinite is every bit as effective in the former area, but in the raw graphics department it fails to make anywhere near the same impact on either Microsoft or Sony’s box.</p>

<h1 class="about">Overall</h1>
<p class="par2">In the end we reccommend to play bioshock infinite it was fun to play but it an old game and has many bugs so we give it 8.5/10 </p>
