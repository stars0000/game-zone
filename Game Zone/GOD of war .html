<h1 class="about">Overviwe for the God of war </h1>
<p class="par2">God of War Ragnarok is indeed an amazing game, the journey of our beloved and iconic character Kratos. God of War 2018 is still the same, but not Atreus.
Was God of War Ragnarok the perfect formula for presenting these events? Mother.
In fact, the game God of War Ragnarok is another version of God of War Ragnarok is additional content (DLC) to its predecessor God of War 2018, but this does not mean that it offers a great story and events.</p>


<h1 class="about">Fighting system</h1>

<p class="par2">Unfortunately, we did not see any noticeable change in the game style, specifically in the Skill Tree skills. It is almost an exact copy of the same skills that we saw in the previous part, with some very minor changes such as the Token and Skill Labor system that allows the player to strengthen some skills beyond the normal rate and add some new effects to them.

Despite this, a new weapon was added to the game, which allowed playing in a somewhat new style, which is very welcome.</p>


<h1 class="about">The puzzles</h1>
<p class="par2">As usual, God of War has an excellent puzzle stage design in the series. And those stages were distributed beautifully as a beautiful break between each fight. Which helped break the cycle a bit.</p>

<h1 class="about">The enemies</h1>
<p class="par2">Santa Monica Studio has learned from their mistakes in the past part in a very important point, which is the diversity of enemies and bosses in general. And although the vast majority of enemies are already from the past part, we saw a remarkable development in the diversity of Bosses in particular. However, the enemies of the one Realm were not diverse enough.</p>

<h1 class="about">Text and dialogues</h1>
<p class="par2">What a bad feeling when you go back in time to the old parts of God of War, such as parts of God of War Chains of Olympus or God of War II, God of War III and other versions, to hear the genius dialogue that contains powerful words that benefit greatness and convey the meaning more than Wonderful, which provides you with an integrated experience to engage later in God of War Ragnarok, to find that the game suffers greatly from the sluggish terminology and dialogue text used.

Apart from the character of Kratos himself, we find many other characters who use many broken terms that do not fit with the time or the general atmosphere of the game or the epic story with the greatness of this God of War, in addition to many moments in which you will find some scenes that contain an imposed sense of humor and A bit tacky</p>

<h1 class="about">Story and character development</h1>
<p class="par2">We will not talk in detail about the story to avoid spoiling any events, but we will suffice to say that the story of God of War Ragnarok complements its predecessor very well, as it contains very many meanings and aspires to develop characters in a very large way, which is what it succeeded in.

But was development in this way the right combination for Kratos and the game in general? In my humble opinion, I respect the development of characters very much in any game, but the path taken by Santa Monica Studio is the same path taken by Naughty Dog Studio, in many situations I felt that I was playing The Last of US instead of God of War. Is this really the appropriate change to the identity of the God of War we have always loved? Or is it a journey down another road away from the identity of the game we grew up enjoying? God of War 2018 and God of War Ragnarok are really great games. But they are great as two separate games and not as two games from the same God of War series, which has a unique special combination that made the game an inspiration for many developers and made many people fall in love with it.</p>

<h1 class="about">Technical problems</h1>
<p class="par2">During my God of War Ragnarok experience I only encountered one Bug related to the Lunda's Armor quest. As for the Camera Lock system, it is very bad, and most of the time it does not work as it should. Although the main goal of the Camera Lock feature is to keep you on your target, more often than not you will find that the camera locks on its own.</p>


<h1 class="about">User interface and accessibility</h1>
<p class="par2">Unfortunately, the UI or user interface of the God of War Ragnarok game has not been changed. In fact, it is an exact copy of its predecessor, which was not good from the beginning. It is a bit boring and old compared to other new versions.</p>


<h1 class="about">overall</h1>
<p class="par2">In the end we reccomend to play god of war ragnarok even if it has disadvantage but it is still fun to play and it gets 9/10 </p>
