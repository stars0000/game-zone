<h1 class="about">Overviwe for call of duty moderwarfare2</h1>
<p class="par2">Modern Warfare 2's greatest strength is that it doesn't have a gimmick, because it doesn't need one.

All Modern Warfare 2 needs to be is a great shooter, and it delivers. This is the Call of Duty experience, deconstructed, reconsidered, and obsessively optimized over 15 uninterrupted years of iteration. I know when I'm playing a Black Ops game because it has offbeat arcade modes and the latest iteration of Nuketown. I know I'm playing a Modern Warfare game because the shooting is so finely tuned that I want to take my Gunsmith build out to dinner. Infinity Ward has officially mastered the instant gratification of aiming down sights and deleting targets.

That goes a long way, though some of Modern Warfare 2's biggest swings, such as revamped progression and a genre-bending campaign, are less elegant. It also suffers from an obtuse UI, fits of crashes, weird bugs, and the unexplained absence of basic features like stat tracking. But altogether, it's a good year for Call of Duty.</p>

<h1 class="about">Gun play</h1>
<p class="par2">I said in 2019's CoD review that Modern Warfare "sets the bar high for first-person gun feel." Consider Modern Warfare 2 the new bar. Ballistics are once again physically simulated (not hitscan), but you wouldn't know it from playing on regular 6v6 maps. On arena maps with short sightlines, guns behave like lasers that instantly tag targets. Jump into a 64-player Ground War match and the same guns accommodate to firefights spanning entire city blocks, requiring players to lead shots and account for bullet drop. It's kind of wild how flexible and seamless the system is—even in the most recent Battlefield, a series that's dealt in simulated ballistics for 20 years, guns are a little too slow up close Modern Warfare 2's silky physics compare favorably if you've been playing Vanguard for the past year, or even better if you've stuck with Cold War for the last two. I never quite got over Cold War's noticeably sluggish hit detection; it'd take around 5-7 frames for point-blank shots to register in my tests. Under similarly unscientific testing conditions (me counting frames in replays recorded at 60 fps), MW2's latency is a far less noticeable 2-3 frames. It's not clear to me exactly how many factors are at play here. It could be that Treyarch's guns appear slower because they are slower by design, but regardless, Infinity Ward's interpretation is better.</p>




<h1 class="about">wrap up</h1>
<p class="par2">It's easy to look at Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and write it off as "just the same thing again." And yes, Modern Warfare 2 is 'yet another' CoD with M4s, red dots, kill streaks, and a fun (but conventional) 7-hour campaign. But to me and the millions of enthusiastic fans who play these games every year, Modern Warfare 2 isn't the latest Call of Duty game—it's the latest Infinity Ward game. And nobody does Call of Duty better than Infinity Ward.

In the three years since Infinity Ward made the best CoD in years with Modern Warfare 2019(opens in new tab) and then shipped the immediately successful Call of Duty: Warzone, the series has been moving backwards. Cold War(opens in new tab) was a fun distraction with flashy '80s locales, approximately a billion modes, and boring guns. Vanguard, armed with the MW2019 engine, was a better shooter, but also a WW2 revival that nobody asked for.

Modern Warfare 2 is exactly what I was asking for. As the stewards of Call of Duty filling the gap left by no new game coming in 2023, and the upcoming Warzone 2.0, Activision is putting its full weight behind Infinity Ward as a lead studio. Modern Warfare 2 is a good argument that they're the right folks for the job.</p>

<h1 class="about">campaing</h1>
<p class="par2">Oh that's right, this gargantuan multiplayer shooter also has a very pretty seven-hour campaign that oozes "expensive" from every corner. As covered in earlier impressions(opens in new tab), Modern Warfare 2's campaign is more about living a series of spectacular moments than following its rote geopolitical drama. This year, Call of Duty trades a fictional corner of the Middle East for a fictional corner of Mexico, Las Almas, controlled by a cartel. That cartel happens to be harboring the international terrorist in Captain Price's crosshairs.

Infinity Ward saw the enthusiasm around the return of Captain Price and Gaz in MW2019 and has raised us one Soap MacTavish and a Ghost. The campaign really likes to indulge in the return of its spec ops quartet. The opening mission concludes with a reintroduction of Ghost presented with the same reverent, legendary air of Han Solo's return to Star Wars At first I thought Infinity Ward was assigning unearned esteem to characters that, at their original peak, were one-note "follow me" companions created to be picked off one by one—most people only remember Ghost because of the way he's killed—but honestly, these meatheads carry more nostalgic power within me than I thought. I did get excited when Ghost first appeared, and I even liked seeing Soap's stupid mohawk again (a fashion choice that stands out a lot more than it did in 2009). The gang still brings almost nothing to the table in terms of personality, but occasional moments of in-mission dialogue choices (think Titanfall 2) are a modest attempt at selling them as a brotherhood.

The campaign's 17-mission run is a healthy mix of familiar corridor shootouts and digressions into gimmicky experiments. You won't find Treyarch-style multiple endings or side quests, but there are a few truly memorable missions. My favorite, Recon By Fire, is an evolution of Call of Duty 4's iconic "All Ghillied Up" mission with a sandboxy twist. I also loved the first half of Prison Break, which briefly turns an FPS into an isometric tactics game as Soap guides Ghost through a risky solo infiltration via CCTV cameras.</p>
