<h1 class="about">overviwe of Asterigos</h1>
<p class="par2">Asterigos is an Adventure-RPG game, but it's a bit linear, but its linearity wasn't detrimental to the gaming experience at all. The game presented the PRG style in a classic simplified image that we had been missing for a long time. Every decision you make during the game will affect the ending and the axis of events.</p>

<h1 class="about">Gameplay</h1>
<p class="par2">The game falls under the classic Hack and Slash genre, and although the game is somewhat independent, the quality provided by the studio was beyond expectations. And the final product of the game surpassed that of the game's demo. The game also added the ability to choose the level of difficulty, so that the experience is suitable for all players.</p>

<h1 class="about">Tools and Items</h1>
<p class="par2">The game added a type of tools that supports players by providing some additional skills that the player can use in his journey and to hone his skills. It is the Trinket system that offers a unique skill for every Trinket you find during your exploration of the world..</p>

<h1 class="about">graphic</h1>
<p class="par2">The art form and the world presented by Asterigos from a technical point of view is a delightful and beautiful form. The colors are vibrant and the design of the characters and monsters was lively to the highest degree, which reminds me of the game Kena: Bridge of Spirits to a large extent. Although the game is not characterized by realism, but the level of graphics presented was beautiful and a beautiful degree of implementation.</p>

<h1 class="about">overall</h1>
<p class="par2">Asterigos is a great game for anyone looking for a nice classic adventure RPG that has nice story elements and offers a classic, yet relevant level of gameplay.</p>
