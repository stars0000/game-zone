<h1 class="about">about our game store</h1>
<p class="par">Let's start from the beginning, in 2001. When the Egyptian market first met the new generation of gaming consoles as a new entertainment device, Not just for youngsters, But for everyone who can afford the device.

 

We've started in the transition between legacy and modern generations at the time. Had the courage to be the beacon, and the will to start growing the gaming community in Egypt.

 

That was the idea, Then there was the first step in the thousand miles road. We chose to be the first to provide the market with a new retail perspective and put SALES ADVISING on top of our list.

 

Dealing with this field when it was just born was hard, But we managed to give the customer what he needs; As a newcomer, it was so difficult to learn all these details our company gives. But with consistent development and the ability to learn, We've been the best choice in the field for newcomers and also the veterans.</p>
<h1 class="video">why video game field?</h1>
<p class="par2">"New" means the riskiest way, But risks with hard work are the formula of greatness _That's what we learn from video games, And we chose to take that way and it turns out to be the best, Not just for us as a Company. But also for the Egyptian gamers community.</p>
